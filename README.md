## What is this project?

This project is a web-based data visulaization to try and pick the best solar water heater option for the _Solar Stove Project_.

### Main Goals:

- Simulate the payback period and other factors to compare different solar water heaters

### Notes:

P = R / T
_Payback period = Reduction in cost of wood / total cost of system_

Variables:
- Glazed Plate Panels
	- *Required Delta T*
	- Panel Model
	- Panel Efficiency
	- Model Cost
		- Panel Cost
		- Tank Cost
		- [PV powered pump]
- DC/PV Panel Water Heater System
- ~Water Tank~
	- ~Thermal Resistivity~
	- ~Size of Tank~
